It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.
The sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new.
Big Brother is watching you.
Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four.
If that is granted, all else follows.
War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.
We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.
