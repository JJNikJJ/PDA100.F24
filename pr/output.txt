It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.
The sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new.
Big Brother is watching you.
Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four.
If that is granted, all else follows.
War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.
We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.
Yes.
No.
Maybe.
Most likely.
Definitely yes!
Definitely no!
Ask again later.
All signs point to yes.
Not now.
Without a doubt.
Unclear.
Things will turn out for the best.
Better not think about it.
Try again.
I doubt it.
Yes, but not right away.
